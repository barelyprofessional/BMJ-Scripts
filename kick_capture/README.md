This directory contains scripts related to VOD capturing and handling errors.

If you wish to reuse these scripts for your own purposes, please ensure you
1. Update the channel ID in `main.py` as it's hardcoded to BossmanJack
2. Update the executable path in `main.py` to whatever you'll use for capturing
3. Inspect bmj_dl.bat for hardcoded paths and ensure UA matches your browser
4. Use an extension (ex. Auto Refresh Page) to avoid Cloudflare issues
